This repository contains C++ code for building a basic snake game.

A basic Snake Game made using C++ programming language which follows below mentioned workflow
1. The player can move the snake in four directions (left, right, up, down) using the keys 'A', 'S', 'W', 'Z' respectively.
2. The score increases when the snake head (represented as 'O') overlaps with the food (represented as '#') and the food appears at another random location.
3. The snake will respawn if it hits the boundaries. It can respawn three times before game over.
4. Game over if snake head overlaps its own body (represented with '*').
